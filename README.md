Northcoders Front-end Project
NC News

Welcome to my NC News project that combines my [back-end](https://nc-news-api-hjp3.onrender.com/api/) project with a modern Vite app which you can use to browse through articles, vote on them and add/delete comments at will.

You can browse through the site by using the following [link](https://fe-project-nc-news.vercel.app/)

NOTE: You will require Node version 18 to be able to run this project locally.

To do so, you will need to:

1. Fork the [repo](https://github.com/prgf87/fe-project-nc-news) and then clone it from your fork.

`git clone <your-repo-name.git>`

2. Navigate into your newly cloned repo and use `code .` to launch VSCode.

3. Run `npm i` in your terminal to install all the necessary dependecies (make sure to navigate into your newly cloned folder before running this command!)

4. Run `npm run dev` to run the app locally on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

I hope you enjoy browsing through this minimal example.
